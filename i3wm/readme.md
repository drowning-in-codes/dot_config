i3wm's ecosystem is very strong, but most wms (including i3) themself only contains some window management and other functions, while the launcher, file manger, wallpaper switching and so on do not have the function, so you need to match with other applications.

for example, you may also need:

- rofi   app launcher
- picom(or compton)  compositor to add smooth window transition
- polybar(or i3blocks) alternative to i3status bar
- feh(or swww) change wallpaper
- ranger(or yazi) terminal file manger
- alacritty(or kitty) terminal w/ emulator
- dunst for notification(alternative to i3-nagbar)
